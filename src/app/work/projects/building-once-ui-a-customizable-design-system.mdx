## Overview

Developed a fully functional cross-platform WhatsApp clone — one for Android using Java, and another for the Web using the MERN stack — focusing on real-time communication, user authentication, and clean, responsive UI.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Integrated Socket.IO for instant messaging on the web, and Firebase Realtime Database on Android to enable live chat capabilities.
- **User Authentication**: Implemented secure login and signup features using Firebase Authentication on Android and JWT with MongoDB for the web version.
- **Media Sharing**: Enabled users to share images and files seamlessly in both versions, stored using Firebase Storage and MongoDB GridFS.
- **Responsive UI/UX**: Designed intuitive and familiar chat interfaces, ensuring consistency and ease-of-use across devices.
- **Syncing and Persistence**: Ensured messages and media were stored persistently with proper syncing mechanisms across sessions and platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **Android (Java)**: For building a native mobile experience.
- **Firebase**: For real-time database, authentication, and cloud storage in the Android version.
- **MERN Stack**: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js to build the WhatsApp Web clone.
- **Socket.IO**: For enabling real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and server.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was maintaining real-time sync and seamless media handling across both platforms. Android required a deep integration with Firebase for real-time updates, while the web version needed robust back-end architecture using Node.js and MongoDB. Handling media uploads efficiently, along with implementing responsive chat UI, enhanced the learning in full-stack development and real-time communication.

## Outcome

The Android and Web WhatsApp clones are fully operational and showcase real-time features, media sharing, and user authentication. These projects reflect strong proficiency in both mobile and web development stacks, with a focus on performance, user experience, and scalable architecture.
